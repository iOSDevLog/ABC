ABC Test

My child is 3 and a half years old. I want to check the mastery of his English letters and Arabic numerals.

So I made this app, I prepared a test to generate 100 letters and numbers randomly, if the child's answer is right, <right +1>, otherwise <wrong +1>

Finally, a transcript can be generated so that I can judge whether the child has made progress based on the transcript.

I hope you like this app.
